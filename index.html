      <h1>Best Series of All Time</h1>
      <p>Steins;Gate is an adaptation of the visual novel of the same name. It is set in 2010 in Akihabara, Tokyo, and follows Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed "mad scientist", who runs the "Future Gadget Laboratory" in an apartment together with his friends Mayuri Shiina and Itaru "Daru" Hashida.</p>
      <p>While attending a conference about time travel, Okabe finds the dead body of Kurisu Makise, a neuroscience researcher; he sends a text message about it to Daru and later discovers that Kurisu is alive and that the message arrived before he sent it. The laboratory members learn that the cell phone-operated microwave oven they are developing can send text messages back in time; they are joined by Kurisu, and investigate it, sending text messages – referred to as "D-mails" – to the past to change the present.</p>

    <h1>There is no end though there is a start in space. — Infinite.
      It has (its) own power, it ruins, and it goes though there is a start also in the star. — Finite.
      Only the person who (has) wisdom can read the most foolish one from the history.
      The fish that lives in the sea doesn't know the world in the land. It also ruins and goes if they have wisdom.
      It is funnier that man exceeds the speed of light than fish start living in the land.
      It can be said that this is (a) final ultimatum from the god to the people who can fight.
